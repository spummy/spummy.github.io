<p>On the notion of my <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/Pc62VHsKtDo">most recent original acoustic song video</a>…</p>

<p>Would you guys like me to tell u when i wrote these songs in the video’s descriptions?</p>

<p>I think that information is a fun, but I try to leave stuffz like that out as to not muddy any waters.</p>

<p>Any time I perform, I want to do my best to honor the song as much as I can, however feels right to me emotionally in that moment.</p>

<p>It’s cool too, cuz any time i play one of my songs for u guys, chances are, it’ll be slightly different than any other time i’ve played it. In my opinion, even the smallest difference creates a completely new experience for us to enjoy. That can be a simple note change, to the way I soften or harden my voice. This too is another reason why I enjoy the jazz mindset so much!***</p>

<p>I feel like for u guyz, adding extra details could muddy the perception of hearing a song for the first time. I’m down to give fun facts about my headspace when writing these songs, or any other details you may be interested in, if yous want!</p>

<p>I think I have at least 1 abstract detail/connection for each song.</p>

<p>Anyways, please do ask any clarifying questions about my art, mindset or philosophies whenever they pop up!</p>

<p>I usually try to let the art speak for itself, but as a psychology and philosophy oriented person, I understand that interpretations of any artistic works can benefit from the insights of the author.</p>

<p>So, let me know if ur curious!</p>

<p>I have lots i wanna say, tho i really am in no rush to let it all out at once! Doing slow drips keeps things fresh anyways, and it gives a chance for any passerbyers to join in on the experience too without feeling like they need to do a lot of catch up work.</p>

<p>(Tho i try to structure the delivery of my art where it invites the curious to dig deeper if they want. It’s partially why I enjoy the concept of “feeding into my abyss” so much. Since the beginning, i have always favored depth over instant delivery. Those who are curious have a long breadcrumb trail to follow, and i try not to spoil the rewards by dumping it all in one place.)</p>

<p>I’m sure one of these days, after i pop off and become a global sensation, i’ll get a really astute interviewer who can help me appreciate this heaping pile of  (sh)art in a way we can all enjoy, anywayz.</p>

<p>I’m just happy to be riding in the first place… and I am so thankful for everyone who is strolling along! Or should i say, uhhh scrolling! A heh.. tehe…</p>

<p>anyways, i’m sure that is all obvious to anyone who has been around for more than 20 minutes of consuming my work..</p>

<p>I truly love what I do. I feel so honored to be given this opportunity to build this little universe here for us all to appreciate. My parents have helped me so much, it’s unbelievable. And I am so grateful to be here every day.</p>

<p>And i am so grateful for all of you dudes too! To my long time homies/supporters, my new friends that hop in the comments every so often, and I am so grateful for my lurkers too!</p>

<p>It’s insane how many of y’all have stuck around with me all these years… i’m still comprehending it all.. and it feels like my heart grows every time i think about you guys.</p>

<p>Your presence means so much, and I am sure i would have given up pursuing creativity as a vocation had i been alone this time.. i am so sure.</p>

<p>You guys give me strength every day, and i appreciate the gentle reminders of warmth and presence you all send as i pour my heart out in the form of these breadcrumbs across the internet.</p>

<p>I see the future already, and we.. myself and y’all, the Teejsters…. are going to shape history..</p>

<p>And we will serve as anchors for the cultures of the world for generations to come, as far as my little asian blind eyes can see..</p>

<p>I hope you are all ready.</p>

<p>Tho I am sure our independent lives will have an endless amount of new pits and tunnels to drive thru….</p>

<p>I have no doubt in my mind that in this tunnel right now.. in my little echo chamber of niche obscurity and absurd mental health awareness (or unawareness heh, if u were here last year you would get it.)</p>

<p>That faint glimmer in the distance will be within arms reach before any of us know it!</p>

<p>The tunnel will wish us farewell soon enough.</p>

<p>And then we can meet the world anew.. and it will wrap us in an unfamiliar warmth as we immerse ourselves in the glory this newfound light.</p>

<p>.

<p>Ok byeee!</p>

<p>I have always seen my songs as standards (like Jazz Standards, where they have a loose form and anyone can integrate their own personalities in its expession!). So, you already know I have an endless amount of content coming our way :D</p>

<p>So again, please feel free 2 request any of my songs any time, and I’ll get to it sooner than later!</p>
