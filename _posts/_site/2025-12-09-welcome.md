 Dear Diary,
 I realized that I have so much goin on in my mind... and I forgot that I was a (terrible) writer hehe.
Plus, I have been wondering how I can bridge my communities.. It's weird having separate audiences in Youtube, Tiktok, or Instagram.

I was thinking about doing a mailing list, which I still may do for some reason (idk. entrepreneurs recommend it, so I'll try it! I think it's smart in the sense that any or all of my accounts could get banned, and I would lose all touch w the homies in an instant...)

But yeah, what better way to ramble my nonsense, and incoherently witness myself in the form of written word than to add a blog to my website, a project which... exists! :D

like, whoaa. I have a website, haha.

That's so cool. I should be utilizing this more! There is so much more potential than I know.

Annyywayyzz, so yeah.

WELCOME to the blog!

See you in the next post besties.

(don't  talk to me don't look at me don't smell at me don't you even think about it!) 

nah, you can talk to me tho.
